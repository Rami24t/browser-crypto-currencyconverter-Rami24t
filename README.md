- Then, the user will be able to convert the crypto currency into another selected currency e.g. USD/EUR etc
- Allow to user to choose either BTC, ETH or LTC for the cryptocurrency
- Allow to user to choose either EUR, GBP or USD for the currency
- The result will, then, be displayed to the user

## Instructions
